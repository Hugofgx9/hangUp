# hangUp


## Context
A one week Student Project
Small game work with reactNative, express and Socket.io


## Make it run

- better way : run it separatly

cd reactNativ
npm run start

cd ../back
npm run start


- globally run the reactNative and express local server;

npm run dep 
npm run start

the second will start front en backend server 
you must stop the servers manually : $ killall node
